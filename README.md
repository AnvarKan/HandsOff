**Put! Down! Your! Phone!**

Hands Off is a free, minimalist widget designed to interrupt your scroll habit and remind you to reclaim your time, focus, and presence.

No logins. No tracking. No distractions. Just one goal: make you stop using your phone when you didn’t mean to.

**Features:**
- Blunt, bold, or kind reminders – you choose.
- Lock screen + Home screen widgets.
- Customize colors, styles, and messages.
- No notifications, adverts, or dopamine traps.
- Free. Forever.

Take a walk. Drink some water. Be intentional. Do literally anything else, just put down your phone.

## Building the code

You'll need Xcode 16 or later, along with the iOS 18 simulator, but that's it – this is a really tiny project, but hopefully it's still useful for folks.


## Contribution guide

Any help you can offer with this project is most welcome – if you can translate it to another language, if you can add some interesting features or fix bugs, or if you can improve the documentation, it's all welcome.

**Please ensure that SwiftLint returns no errors or warnings before you send in changes.**
